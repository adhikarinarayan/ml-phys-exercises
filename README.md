Machine Learning in Physics
===========================

These are the exercise notebooks for the Machine Learning class I taught
in Spring 2021.

These exercises were graded using JupyterHub and nbgrader.
Please email me if you are a lecturer and want to have the solutions.

There is a playlist with the [lecture videos] available.
